# Get Swifty

**Swift has come a far way since it was first released in 2014.**

It’s now an open source language that can be used for much more than iOS development. Although my day-to-day interaction with Swift is mostly in the context of iOS dev, I’m excited to dive into the language itself and learn more about its various applications, starting with this blog series!

Here, we’ll be exploring the Swift 4 programming language, from the preferred way to write code (“idiomatic Swift”) to cool, trippy things such as optionals and closures that you may not have heard about before. I’ll take you through the code line-by-line so that there’s absolutely no confusion about what you’re doing — goodbye, copying and pasting chunks of code from YouTube that you only understand 50% of.

## What is that … bird thing in your drawing?

That’s supposed to be an anthropomorphized version of the bird that the Swift community uses as their logo. I asked a few people whether it was creepy or cute. The general consensus was that it was both, which is of course the best outcome.

## Recommended Background Knowledge

You should be familiar with basic programming concepts (variable declaration/ initialization, loops, operations, etc). Bonus if you’ve dealt with object-oriented programming languages before. If you haven’t, you should still be able to follow along, but I’ll be focusing a lot more on Swift’s particular paradigms than on the fundamentals of how programming works.

## No Need for a Mac

Instead of using Playgrounds to write and test our code, we’ll be working in the IBM Swift Sandbox, a totally-online programming environment. This way, users without Macs can still execute code. IBM Swift Sandbox will show you all of your errors in-line. I personally find the errors to be more descriptive than the ones in Playgrounds.

## A (Very) Rough Content Outline

I’m not trained in education or anything — I’m literally just a kid who thinks Swift is cool and reads about pedagogy in her free time. Thus, I’ll most likely be re-organizing my content plan for this series as we progress along the course. Here are the basics of what I intend to cover:

[Variables and Constants](http://asianbarbie.com/swift-variables-constants/)

Data Types

Operations

Control Flow

Functions

Optionals

Arrays

Dictionaries

Sets

Closures

Structs

Properties

Methods

Classes

Enums

Value vs. Reference Types

Protocols

Generics

Custom Operators

Pattern Matching

Error Handling

Type Serialization/Deserialization

Asynchronous Closures

Memory Management

Sound fun? Awesome! I’ll see you on the other side.
